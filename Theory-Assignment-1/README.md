## Usage

compiling the code - g++ -std=c++11 buddy_algorithm.cpp -o buddy
to execute the code - ./buddy <file_name> 
ex: ./buddy input1.dat

Here, the executable being created is ./buddy and different request patterns are present in the files input1.dat, input2.dat, input3.dat, input4.dat and input5.dat

input1.dat - have the given test file along with a test case in which sometimes free blocks on left side of the tree also exist.
input2.dat - this have the test case like requests ar e made exactly in powers of 2 and they are being deallocated faster.
input3.dat - this contain bursty requests.
input4.dat - this contain data doing same requests.
input5.dat - this asks to allocate same amount of memory and deallocates and ask the different amount of memory but all the proccesses ask the same amount of memory.
